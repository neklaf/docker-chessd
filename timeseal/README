Introduction
------------

This chess server supports the 'timeseal' protocol for keeping more
accurate track of players' time usage.

Unlike previous chess servers that had to have the timeseal code built
in in this server uses a small external timeseal_decoder process whose
sole purpose is to decode the timeseal protocol. You can enable this
process (and thus enable timeseal support) using the -T option to
chessd.

The reasons I designed it this way are:

    - it keeps the timeseal protocol secret, and the protocol relies
      on its secrecy to prevent cheating
    - it allows me to use GPLd code in the chess server while not
      distributing the timeseal decoder source code


Using timeseal
--------------

To use timeseal in your chess server just pass the location of your
timeseal_decoder binary to the -T option. For example:

		 bin/chessd -T bin/timeseal_decoder -p 5000

If you also use the -R option to setup a secure chroot jail for your
chess server then you must pass the -T option before the -R option.
