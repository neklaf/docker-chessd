Chessd 0.1

- The configuration system does not use TDB (Trivial Data Base) anymore.

- Data of games and users are stored in a database using PostgreSQL,
  not in text archives anymore.

- Now there is a a web interface, created in PHP, running in an Apache
  server. This interface allows the user to access the new functions
  in the server, such as forum, and also allows easy access to the old
  functions.

- It was created a section called "Learning On Line", where users can
  have chess lessons and also include new lessons.

- Some commands had been removed of the server and are now available
  in the web interface. An example is the finger command, now
  available in the web page.

- It was created a new system to rank users. There are new levels,
  for example: Helper (H), that defines the users that are going to
  help other users; Tournament Manager (TM), that defines the
  users that are going to organizate matches; and the
  Adjudicator (AD), for users that are going to adjudicate games
  that had been interrupted in the server.

- The channels of the server had been reorganized. For
  example: Channel 253 now is the "Helpers' Channel", it can
  be used only by helpers (or users with superior administration
  level). Channel 254 is the "Managers' Channel", can be used by
  managers, helpers, adjudicators, etc.. Channel 252 is the "Master
  Channel". Everything that it is said in any channel is heard in
  channel 252, and only admins have access to it and no one can speak in
  Channel 252. These changes aim at better organization of the server.

- Many bugs had been repaired.
