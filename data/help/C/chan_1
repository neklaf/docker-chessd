  Channel 1 is the server help channel.  Admins and other helpful,
knowledgeable users monitor channel 1 and are ready to assist you.  It is also
a general server discussion channel about server issues.

  If you need assistance about something but don't know whom to contact, ask
your question on channel 1.  Here's the procedure:

(1) Type the following lines:

  channel 1                     [this will turn channel 1 on for you]
  tell 1 Can someone help me?   [this sends the message to channel 1]

(2) Watch your screen for someone asking you what help you need.  You may be
contacted directly (in a personal tell) or through channel 1 itself (so
everyone can listen to to the discussion and help out).

(3) If you want to continue talking on channel 1, type:

  tell 1 <message>              [everyone on channel 1 will hear you]

(4) When you are done, you can either stay on channel 1, in order to help
others and/or learn from their questions, or turn off channel 1 by typing:

  channel 1                     [this will set channel 1 to off for you]

To see who is listening to channel 1 at any given moment, type "inch 1".  A
list will appear.
