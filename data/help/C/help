help

Usage: help [topic]

  Prints information on the given topic.  If topic is omitted, then "help"
will provide instructions for displaying several, useful help files.  Also,
typing "help commands" will list all commands, typing "info" will list the
help files for non-commands, and typing "index" will display the general
categories of help files.

  When you request information about a command, the help file will describe
the format for the command ("Usage").  Words in square brackets [] designate
optional variables; including them affects the way your command will be
processed.

  Some help files are longer than one screen.  To continue reading the file,
type "next" (or its alias "more").

  If you need help while on the server, use channel 1 to contact people who
can help you (see chan_1 help file).
