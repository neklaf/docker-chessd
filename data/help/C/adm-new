About becoming an FICS administrator

  Thank you for asking about how someone becomes an FICS administrator
("admin").  As the "adm-info" help file notes, the number of FICS admins is
kept small for several reasons.  At the moment, we are not accepting
applications from anyone to be an admin.  If additional admins are needed, we
will contact you.

  In the meantime, the best way for you to help with FICS needs is to monitor
messages on the various FICS channels and help users who have questions, let
us know about bugs you find (message to "bug"), and make suggestions about
improvements you would like to see implemented (message to "suggestion" or to
"helpfiles").  If you have code you'd like to contribute, contact one of the
programming admins (see "admins" help file for a listing).  Typing "=admin"
lists the current admins.  Typing "in 0" will give a list of admins currently
logged on.
