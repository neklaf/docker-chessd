
pstat

The command pstat ("player statistics") displays the record one user has in 
chess games against another user.  Statistics 'pstat' will not include 
results prior to FICS version 1.22.0   pstat will only include statistics
from your last 2500 games on the server.  In general, this command can be 
used with the following formats:

  (a) pstat /o User1 -- gives your record against User1

  (b) pstat User1 /o User2 -- gives the record for User1 against User2

  For example, the command 'pstat knighttour /o afw' might display the 
  following statistics:

          knighttour's game statistics:

          Results vs. afw:
          Rated(W-L-D): 10-10-5    Unrated(W-L-D): 8-8-2

  The counts are always with respect to the FIRST player -- it is the first
player's record against the second player, in this case knighttour's record
against afw.  The counts are summed across ALL types of chess matches.

   (c) For the time being Old statistics can be accessed using the command: 
       oldpstat (which is what pstat used to be).  The oldpstat command can
       be used in the same format as in examples (a), (b) and (c); without
       the flag /o. 

   For example, the command 'oldpstat toddmf Obliviax" might display the 
   following statistics:

           Record for toddmf vs. Obliviax:

                            wins     losses     draws
                rated        407        345        68
              unrated         14          6         4


Other Notes:
Pstat shows result summaries starting from your latest games and looks 
backwards. 

It is now possible to use the 'next' command in conjunction with a helpfile and
at the same time use the command 'next stats'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The parameters for pstat are in the following usage format:

 pstat [user] [type of results to show] [how to sort]

 [user] is the name of the player whose statistics are to be viewed
 if a name is missing in this command, it will show your data.

 [type of results to show] and [how to sort] are based on four sort parameters:
 (opponent, eco code, etime and category/board)

To specify results to show (i.e. only those results/summaries will be shown) 
use /o /e /t /b (opponent, eco, (e)time and board/category respectively) 
followed by the parameter. (a) eco code is the Encylopedia of Chess Openings 
code which describes which opening took place. It is a letter A-E followed by
a two digit number.  


1. Sort by ECO: /e

To see what eco code corresponds to a named opening position - see help eco.

   (a) pstat /o User1 /e <code>

   For Example:

         pstat /o DChessmaster /e B09

         Your game statistics:

         Results vs. DChessmaster ECO B09:
         Rated(W-L-D): 2-30-1    Unrated(W-L-D): 0-0-0


   (b) pstat User 1 /o User2 /e <code>

   For Example:

         pstat Bremen /o DChessmaster /e B09

         Bremen's game statistics:

         Results vs. DChessmaster(C) ECO B09:
         Rated(W-L-D): 5-5-1    Unrated(W-L-D): 0-0-0
 
2. Sort by time: /t

etime is the maximum time 40 moves will take per player. 
The formula is:  etime = time + 2/3 increment

   For example: a 5 0 game is etime 5
                a 2 12 game is etime 10
                a 5 8 game is etime 6.7

Please see help clocks for more details.
This sort command is somewhat difficult, please read carefully.

Results are grouped together in ranges of time and it's not possible to 
specify a decimal number etime. So to request results for 5 8 (etime 6.7) 
6.7 should be rounded down to 6.

In the example above where etime is 6.7; you would have to use etime of 6

   (a) pstat /t <etime>

   For Example:

         pstat /t 5

         Your game statistics:

         Results vs. DHessmaster(C) ECO B09:
         Rated(W-L-D): 5-5-1    Unrated(W-L-D): 0-0-0

 Show me the summary of my games that have etime 5 (covers 5<etime<=6).

   (b) pstat User2 /t <etime>

   For Example:

         pstat volcano /t 6

         volcano's game statistics:

         Results etime 6<=etime<7:
         Rated(W-L-D): 14-2-8    Unrated(W-L-D): 0-0-0




3. Sort by category and board: /b

Category and board are just like the match command (eg. bughouse, suicide, 
wild 5), though the short cut for wild (w/#) does not work and chess is not 
recognized. To get normal chess only use blitz, standard, lightning and 
untimed as the category. Specify blitz and specifying etime as a non blitz 
time control will give undefined results.


To group results together /s followed by one or more o,e,t,b is used. 
It doesn't make sense to specify a type to show and also have it grouped 
together under that type so pstat /o Fred /so is illegal.

 Examples:

 pstat /o Fred /se

 Show my results against Fred by eco code

 pstat /e C21 /sob

 Show my results in C21 by opponent and board/category


 The following group ranges for etime are used:

    0
    0 < etime < 1
    1 <= etime < 2
    2 <= etime < 3
    3 <= etime < 4
    4 <= etime < 5
    5 <= etime < 6
    6 <= etime < 7
    7 <= etime < 8
    8 <= etime < 9
    9 <= etime < 10
   10 <= etime < 11
   11 <= etime < 12
   12 <= etime < 13
   13 <= etime < 14
   14 <= etime < 15
   15 <= etime < 20
   20 <= etime < 25
   25 <= etime < 30
   30 <= etime < 35
   35 <= etime < 40
   40 <= etime < 45
   45 <= etime < 50
   50 <= etime < 55
   55 <= etime < 60
   60 <= etime < 75
   75 <= etime < 90
   90 <= etime < 105
  105 <= etime < 120
  120 <= etime < 150
  150 <= etime < 180
  180 <= etime
