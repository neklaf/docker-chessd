Usage: messages [user [text]] 
LIMITED TO REGISTERED USERS

  This command can do one of four things:

  1)  "Messages" used alone will display all of the stored messages that have
      been sent to you.

  2)  "Messages user" will display all stored messages from you to that user
      and from that user to you.

  3)  "Messages #" will display the message numbered # in your list.

  4)  "Messages user text" will send "text" to the user.  When you "message"
      another user, the text of your "message" will be displayed to you for
      confirmation.  If that user is on, he/she will see the message
      displayed.  If the user is not on, he/she will need to use "message" in
      order to read it.

  Messages will be stored until they are cleared by the recipient.  In
contrast, "tell"s are not stored.  When users log on, they are notified if
they have any stored messages and (if so) how many they have.
