SETTING YOUR PREFERENCES

  Everyone starts out with certain default values and settings, but you may
change them if you wish.  You change settings using the set command; you can
view your current settings (or those of another user) using the variables
command.

  Some settings concern what information the server will transmit to you, such
as communications from other players and notifications about games starting or
users logging on/off.  Other settings concern chess matches, such as your
default time controls, whether you will hear a bell when a new board
position is sent to you, whether you will be sent a list of the moves for your
game automatically when the game is completed (or adjourned), even the format
used to send you the board position.

  By changing these settings, you can create the kind of atmosphere you would
like to have.  You can change these settings at any time, even during a given
session.  For the most part, changes you make to your settings will be saved
after you log off and you will not need to change the settings each time you
log on.

  Your password is also a special setting, although it is never displayed at
any point.  When you register, you are given a logon password.  You may change
your password at any point using the password command.

  Lastly, it is possible for you to create special aliases to save you from
typing phrases you use often.  Instead of typing the whole phrase, all you
do is type your alias.
