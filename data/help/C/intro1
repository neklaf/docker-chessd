GENERAL INFORMATION

  The internet has great capabilities for connecting people from all over
the world.  This chess server is one way for networking individuals who enjoy
chess.  Among other things, the chess server allows users to play chess
matches against each other, as well as communicate with each other.  The chess
server (computer) is programmed to send players' chess moves and messages to
the right users.  It also keeps track of various information.

  In order to use the features, you need to type various commands.  To list
the various commands, type "help".  To get a description of a particular
command, type "help [command]" -- without the square brackets, of course.
NOTE: you do not have to type the entire command in order to use it or read
its help file; typing the first few letters will work in most cases.

  In general, commands do one of four things: (a) send a message to one or
more users (see intro2), (b) display information to you (see intro3), (c)
modify one of your settings/features/functions (see intro 4), or (d) have the
server perform a special function.  Certain commands are restricted to server
administrators ("admins") and cannot be used by regular users.

  New users might want to start off with simple features and gradually learn
about the other features as you go along.  The server allows you to determine
how various information is sent to you.  For example, you can decide how a
position in a chess game is displayed (see style).  You can also set your
preferences about the types of chess matches you would like to have or types
of messages you receive from others (see variables).
