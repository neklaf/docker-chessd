time

Usage: time [game,user]

  Shows the updated time remaining in the specific game for the players
involved.  If no game is specified, the clock readings for your current game
will be shown.  Revised clock times are also given as part of the "refresh"
command; however, "time" will always show negative times whereas "refresh"
will only list negative times if the interface handles them that way.
