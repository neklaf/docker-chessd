sourcecode

  You can get a version of the code via anonymous ftp to 'ics.onenet.net' in
the directory /pub/chess/Unix.

  If you make any changes to the code that you would like to see incorporated
into future releases, please mail them to u940456@daimi.aau.dk.  I'm hoping
that the FICS community will help improve and debug this server.
