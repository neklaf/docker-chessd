xtell

Usage: xtell user message

  The "xtell" command sends a message to a user, just like "tell" does. 
However, "xtell" will not alter the setting for who-you-told-last.  A "tell"
sends a message *and* resets the who-you-told-last variable to a new user. 
The "xtell" command will leave this setting intact, meaning that you can still
use the "." alias to "tell" to a person you are having a conversation with. 
The "xtell" command allows for a brief comment to someone while you are having
a longer chat with someone else.

SPECIAL NOTES:

(a) Xtell works only with tells to players, not to channels.
