private

Usage: set private [n]

  "Private" is one of the variables you can set.  When private is non-zero,
games you play cannot be observed by other users.  If private is 0, other
users will be able to observe your game -- unless your opponent has private
non-zero.  A private game is designated in "games" and "history" displays by
the letter "p".  Also, if a game is private, the eco category is not displayed
in the history table.
