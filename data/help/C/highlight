highlight

Usage: set highlight [0-15]

  Highlight is one of the variables you can change with the "set" command. 
When highlight is non-zero and you receive a personal tell, the sender's
handle will be displayed in a different style thus making the tell more
obvious on your screen.  Other information, such as your location in a ranking
list or who list, will also be displayed to you in a different style thus
making it easier to read.

  There are 15 possible styles.  However, the way they appear on your screen
will depend on many factors.  Try they out to see which style works best for
you.  "Set highlight 0" turns the highlight to neutral (off).
