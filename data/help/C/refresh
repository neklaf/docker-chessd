refresh

Usage: refresh [game]

  Redisplays the given game position and clock times.  If 'game' is omitted,
then the current game you are playing or observing will be redisplayed.  This
command is especially useful if you are using an ascii board style and it
scrolls off the screen, or if you want to confirm the current board position
and/or clock times.  (Time can also be confirmed by the "time" command.)  The
alias for "refresh" is "re".
