flip

Usage: flip

  "Flip" toggles the 'flip' variable on and off.  When 'flip' is on it causes
the board display to be reversed -- either from White at bottom to Black at
bottom, or vice versa.  Changing your flip setting may be especially useful
when observing games or playing team games.  Using this command is equivalent
to "set flip on"/"set flip off".  Because the 'flip' variable is affected,
changes in 'flip' are permanent until you re-set it.
