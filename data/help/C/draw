draw

Usage: draw

  Requests a draw from your opponent.  A draw means that you neither win nor
lose your chess match -- the game will be a tie.  Ratings are affected,
however, unless it was an unrated match.

  If your opponent had offered you a draw, then the command draw (or accept)
would accept the draw offer.  To decline a draw offer, either use the decline
command or make a move instead.

  This command also claims a draw in the case of the 50 move rule or
3 times repetition.  In the case of a draw being requested, the chess server
will check for these conditions.  If one of them is present, the game will be
drawn even without the opponent accepting the draw.
