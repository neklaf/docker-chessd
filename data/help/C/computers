computers

  Computers may register and play chess matches.  However, computers are
required to be registered so that users can know whether they are playing
against humans or computers.  (Using an unregistered computer is considered to
be abusive behavior; see etiquette).  In order to register a computer,
contact an admin or use the correct format in the email registration
procedure.  To see a list of computers registered on the server, type
"=computer".  Computers are designated on "who" lists by (C).
