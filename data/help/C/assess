assess

Usage: assess [user1 [user2]]

  Displays how ratings will be affected by the possible outcomes of a chess
match between two users.  If both parameters are omitted ("assess") and you
are playing a game, then the command will display the possible ratings changes
from your game with your current opponent (if you are not playing a game, you
will be told that).  If only user1 is given ("assess user1"), then the command
will display the possible ratings changes from a game you would have with
user1.  If both parameters are given ("assess user1 user2"), then the command
will display possible ratings results of a game between user1 and user2.
