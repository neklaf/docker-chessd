 
iset
 
Usage: iset ivariable_name [value]
 
  Ivariables are special variables that interface and bot authors can use to
modify the output of the FICS server. They shouldn't normally be touched by
a user and fiddling with them may cause the interface to malfunction (which
can be reset by logging out then in again). Ivariables are not saved between
sessions.

Example:
  iset defprompt 1
 
  Each ivariable has a separate help file to explain how it is used.  Type
"help iv_<variable>" to read a specific file.  For example, to read about the
graph variable you would type "help iv_graph".

When a ivariable has been modified, you will be informed of the new setting as
a way of verifying it. Normally an interface should parse out this message so
that users will not be confused.
