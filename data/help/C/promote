promote

Usage: promote {q,r,b,[kn]}

  Designates the piece that a pawn will be promoted to when it reaches
the back rank.  This is set automatically at the beginning of each game
to 'q'.  The setting can be changed during the game at any point.

SPECIAL NOTE:  You must designate how a pawn will be promoted BEFORE it
reaches the back rank, not afterwards.  The current setting will be used when
the pawn reaches the 8th rank.
