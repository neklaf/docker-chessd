boards

Usage: boards [category]

  If category is given then this lists all available boards for that 
category.  If the parameter is omitted, then this lists all available
categories.  The current board categories are:

    standard
    openings
    wild
    chessercizes
    test
    material-odds
    misc

  In order to find out what is loaded for one of these categories, type
"boards <category>".  For example, "boards openings" will list the various
openings you can start a game from.

  In order to start a game from one of these positions, you need to use all of
the arguments in the match command and also include the board category and the
specific board you want.  For example:

  match red 2 12 0 0 openings ruy-lopez
    
would request a blitz match with user "red" starting with the "ruy-lopez"
opening position.


SPECIAL NOTE

  At the moment, you cannot access these boards through the examine feature,
only match.
