standard

  There are four types of regular (not wild or bughouse) chess played on this
chess server: Untimed, Lightning, Blitz and Standard.

  A game is "Standard" if the expected duration of the game is 15 minutes or
more.  "Expected duration" is determined by a formula that takes into account
both the Start time and the Increment (Inc) value.  Here is the formula:

     Expected duration = (Start + Inc*2/3)

  The following table shows the slowest Blitz and fastest Standard time
controls, the dividing line if you will between those two types of matches.  
[Thanks to schwartzeer for the calculations.  :)  ]

     Slowest Blitz     Fastest Standard
    ------------------------------------
       Mins  Incr         Mins  Incr
    ------------------------------------
         0    22            0    23
         1    20            1    21
         2    19            2    20
         3    17            3    18
         4    16            4    17
         5    14            5    15
         6    13            6    14
         7    11            7    12
         8    10            8    11
         9     8            9     9
        10     7           10     8
        11     5           11     6
        12     4           12     5
        13     2           13     3
        14     1           14     2
        --------           15     0

  As you can see, not every game with more minutes to start is Standard and
not every game with few minutes to start is Blitz.

  You can list logged on users according to their Standard ratings by typing
"who s".  "Standard" is also a variable that can be used in formulas in order
to screen match requests.
