partner

Usage: partner user_name

  This command is used in order to ask another user to become your partner for
a bughouse match.  The other user will need to accept or decline the offer. 
If the other user accepts the partner offer, the two of you will then be able
to hold bughouse matches against other partnerships and the two of you can be
identified using the "bugwho p" command as being available for bughouse
matches.

  You can only 'partner' users who are open for bughouse partnerships, i.e.,
have their bugopen variable set to 1.  To see which users are available for a
bughouse partnership, type "bugwho u".  If you 'partner' a user, your bugopen
variable is automatically set to 1.

  If you type "partner" alone, it will cancel any partnership you have, though
it will not affect your bugopen variable setting.
