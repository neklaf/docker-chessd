fmessage

Usage: fmessage user message_number

  You can forward a "message" you have received to another user by using the
"fmessage" command.  In this way, you can share news with other users without
having to retype the information each time.  Suppose, for example, the third
message in your message list is something you want Hawk to read.  You type
"fmessage Hawk 3".  When you do this, you will receive the feedback that your
message has been forwarded to that user.  When you receive a forwarded
message, it will be clearly designated as a FORWARDED message from a given
user.
