ptime

Usage: ptime

  This command is used during a bughouse match in order to display the current
clock times in your partner's game.

SPECIAL NOTES:

(a) The ptime command is _not_ related to the ptime variable.  The ptime
variable concerns having the current time displayed along with the server
prompt.  See 'help v_ptime' for details.
