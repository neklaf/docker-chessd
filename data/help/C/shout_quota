shout_quota

  In order to encourage users to hold conversations in channels rather than
with "shouts" the server has a shout quota.  A shout quota limits the
frequency of a user's shouts (including "it"-type shouts).  For normal
purposes, the standard shout quota is not a limitation.

  Imposing more strict shout quotas is a sanction for cases of shout abuse.

  If you type "shout" or "it" alone without any message, you will be informed
about your current shout status: either (a) you may shout now, or (b) the time
when you may next make a shout.
