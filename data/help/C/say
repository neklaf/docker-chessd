say

Usage: say message

  Transmits your message to your current opponent if you are playing a
game.  If you are not playing a game, the message is sent to the last
opponent you had in your current logon session.

  "Say" is an easy form of "tell" as you can see, because you do not need to
enter the user's name.  "Say" differs from "kibitz": both commands send a
message to your opponent, but "kibitz" also sends the same message to any
observers of your game and kibitzes can be filtered in various ways.
