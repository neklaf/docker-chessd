pause

Usage: pause

  A "pause" requests asks your opponent that the game you are playing be
paused -- though not adjourned.  An accepted pause request has the effect of
rolling back the clocks to the time of the last move.  If your opponent has
given you a pause request, using the pause command (or accept) will accept the
request.  You may decline a pause request by using the decline command.  To
unpause a game use "unpause".
