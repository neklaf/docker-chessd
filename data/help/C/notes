notes

  A registered user has up to 10 lines in their 'finger' display for posting
information.  These lines are known as "finger notes", one's "plan" or just
"notes".  Your 'notes' can be read by all users of the server, so be sure that
it is information you want to make public.  The notes are numbered from 1 to
10.

  The lines are created, changed and deleted by using the 'set' command.  For
example, "set 1 I love Wild 5!!!" will set your #1 finger note to: "I love
Wild 5!!!".
