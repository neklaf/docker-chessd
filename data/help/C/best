best

Usage: best [b|s|w]

  Displays the 20 highest-rated players in the three different ratings
categories: Blitz, Standard and Wild.  Computers are in the listing.  Use
"hbest" to see the top 20 humans.

  Using "best" alone will give all three lists.  Using one or more of the
arguments b, s or w is a request to give only the blitz, standard and/or wild
best lists, respectively.  For example, "best bw" will show the top 20 players
in blitz and wild chess; the top standard players will not be listed.

  Use "rank" and "hrank" in order to see where a given player is ranked.
