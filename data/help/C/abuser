abuser

  The admins maintain a private list of individuals who have abused the chess
server by intentionally disconnecting in lost positions.  If you suspect that
someone disconnected intentionally, please contact an admin.  The admin will
review the situation.  If you are unable to connect with your opponent in
order to resume your game, you may also want to seek an adjudication.

  If a user has too many stored games, the user may also be placed on the
abuser list until more of the adjourned games are completed or adjudicated.

  Being on the abuser list has these affects: (a) abusers may have match
requests automatically declined if the opponent has "!abuser" in the formula,
and (b) abusers who disconnect while playing a game forfeit the game
automatically.
