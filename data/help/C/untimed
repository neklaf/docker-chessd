untimed

  There are four types of regular (not wild or bughouse) chess played on this
chess server: Untimed, Lightning, Blitz and Standard.

  A game is "Untimed" if the clocks will not be used when playing the game. 
In this case, both the Start and the Increment are 0.  For example, "match
friar 0 0" would request an untimed game against Friar.  The clocks in an
untimed game will not move (though interfaces may handle this in different
ways).  Also, "flag" will not work since the times will never be below 0
seconds.  Lastly, Untimed games are always unrated.
