  We have created several information files for users of this chess server. 
The files describe different features of the server and give you some
suggestions on how these features can help you enjoy internet chess.  Here is
a directory of the information files and what topics each file covers:

      File      Topics
     ------     --------------------------------------------------
     intro1     General information
     intro2     Communicating
     intro3     Displaying information
     intro4     Setting your preferences
     intro5     Special functions
     intro6     Chess matches
     intro7     Making moves in a chess match

  To read information from one of these files, simply type "help intro#" using
the appropriate number.  If you have questions after reading the files, there
are several things you can do.  (1) Read the help file for a command you have
a question about; your answer might be there.  (2) Contact users, especially
administrators of the server (known as "admins"); they are very helpful.

  To read a help file, type "help [topic]", without the square brackets,
however.  If the topic is a command, the help file will give you information
about the format for the command.  You can tell that it is a command because
the first line will describe its format ("Usage").  Words in square brackets
[] designate optional variables; including them affects the way your command
will be processed.  In many cases, a help file will suggest other help files
you may want to read.

  Your suggestions about the information files (and help files, too) are
welcome.  Feel free to "message helpfiles" with your comments.
