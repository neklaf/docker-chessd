hrank

Usage: hrank [user [b][s][w]]
       hrank m-n [b][s][w]

  The first usage shows the ranking of the given user and all human users with
nearby rankings -- computers will be excluded from the rankings.  A second
argument with one or more of the letters b, s, and/or w asks to show only
blitz, standard, and/or wild ratings respectively.  If no second argument is
given, rankings for all three types are shown.  For example, "rank foo bw"
shows the blitz and wild ranking of the player whose handle is "foo".  If
'user' is omitted, your rankings will be displayed.

  The second usage shows all human users ranked between the rankings of M and
N.  The optional third argument again limits which ratings are shown.  For
example, "rank 1-30 sw" lists the human users with the highest 30 standard and
wild ratings.  "hbest" lists the top 20 human users in a category.

  The columns are always sorted by blitz, then standard, then wild.

  Currently, all players with at least 20 games of a particular rating type
are ranked.  If you ask for a player's rank and they do not yet have the 20
games needed to be an active player, the player's current rating will be
displayed in the table but a line (----) will precede the handle to indicate a
provisional ranking.

  To include computers in the list, use "rank".
