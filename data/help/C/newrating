     NEW!  NEW!  NEW!  NEW!  NEW!  NEW!  NEW!  NEW!  NEW!  NEW! 

  We are proud to introduce you to our completely new rating system! 

    --> The Glicko system (developed by Mark E. Glickman) <--
       --> Assistance/corrections by Dmitry Dakhnovsky <-- 
           --> Implemented to FICS by Vek and Hawk <-- 


As you all know, we had a seriously defective rating system, but that
is now changed after two weeks of hard work. 

The previous ratings were bogus and therefore we had to delete them,
and in order to treat all players equally - we have given them the
following two choices:

(1) Transfer their ratings and/or stats from ICC. This can be done by
    leaving me a message FROM ICC (NOTE: I'm called "HawkII"
    there). This will disable any chance of cheating. Just mention your
    FICS handle in your message to me.

(2) Some may not want to have their rating transfered from ICC or
    maybe they dont even have a rating there, then the option is simple:
    the rating will be reset. 

This offer was first published around the 28th of March and will be
available until the 16th of April. (maybe longer)


Every request for ratings transfers must be emailed to me (Hawk) and
my address is "u940456@daimi.aau.dk". Please use subject line:
"Request for ratings transfer" and in the body of the message tell 
me your handle on ICC and FICS. (also remember to message me from ICC
so that I can verify that you are the person you claim to be. NOTE:
My handle on ICC is "HawkII" )
