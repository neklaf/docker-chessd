SPECIAL FUNCTIONS

  There are several commands that perform special functions beyond sending
messages to other users, displaying information, modifying your settings or
playing in a chess match.  Here are some useful ones:

    command        function
    -------        --------------------------------------------
    alias          to make typing frequently-used phrases easier
    examine        to analyze a game
    mailmoves      mails to you the moves of a user's game
    mailoldmoves   mails to you the moves of a user's last game        
    oldmoves       allows you to view a user's last game
    smoves         displays moves of a stored game

More functions will be added as time goes on.
