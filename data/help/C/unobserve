unobserve

Usage: unobserve [game,user]

  Removes a game from your observation list.  You can give either the game
number or the user whose game you want to unobserve.

  For example, if you are observing game #34, KARPOV versus RETI, then
"unobserve 34", "unobserve RETI" or "unobserve KARPOV" will remove this game
from your observation list.

  "Unobserve" used alone removes ALL GAMES from your observation list.
