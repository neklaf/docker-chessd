SPECIAL FUNCTIONS

  There are several commands that perform special functions beyond sending
messages to other users, displaying information or modifying your settings. 
Here are some useful ones:

    -------        --------------------------------------------
    alias          to make typing frequently-used phrases easier
    mailmoves      mails to you the moves of a user's game
    mailoldmoves   mails to you the moves of a user's last game        
    oldmoves       allows you to view a user's last game
    smoves         displays moves of a stored game
    sposition      displays the last position of a stored game

More functions will be added as time goes on.
