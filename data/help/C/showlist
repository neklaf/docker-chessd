showlist

Usage: showlist [list_name]

  This command lists the handles of users on a given list.  The server
maintains various special lists, such as the handles of admins and
grandmasters on the server.  To display the names of available lists, type
"showlist".  Each list will either be READ ONLY, meaning you can display the
listing, or SECRET, meaning only admins can display the listing.  The alias
for "showlist" is "=".  For example, "=admin" will list the handles of the
server admins and "=computers" will list computers that have accounts on the
server.
