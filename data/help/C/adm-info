Information about FICS administrators

  FICS is coordinated by several administrators ("admins") who ensure that
FICS is working properly and deal with problem situations and cases of abuse
(see etiquette).  Certain commands that regulate FICS can only be used by
admins.

  The group of admins is small in order to keep things fair and uniform.  For
the moment, FICS has a sufficient number of admins for its needs, so new
admins are not being added.

  If you have a question, problem situation or concern as a FICS user, feel
free to contact an admin.  They are designated by (*) on "who" lists.  To see
a list of current admins, type "=admin".

  Admins tend to listen to FICS channel 1.  To contact several admins at once,
you can "tell" to channel 1.
