busy

Usage: set busy string

  Sets your "busy" string.  When your busy string is set and people "tell"
something to you, they will get your busy string as a response.  Your busy
string (if on) will also be displayed right below your name when someone
"fingers" you.  NOTE: Your busy string can be no longer than 45 characters.

Examples of busy strings you might use are:
  set busy is really busy right now.
  set busy will be back in 5 minutes.
  set busy will be idle for a while...

  Typing any command cancels your "busy" status; you don't have to clear it
yourself.

  It is useful to use an alias for your busy string, if you intend to use it
frequently.  For example:
  alias idle set busy is away from the keyboard right now
would set your busy string to "is away from the keyboard right now".
