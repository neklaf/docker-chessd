lists

  The server maintains several lists in order to conduct its business.  You
can use +/-/= to change and view the various lists.

Examples (using the aliases):

  +listname member    (Add member to listname -- addlist)

  -listname member    (Remove member from listname -- sublist)

  =listname           (View the members of listname -- showlist)

  =                   (View the names of all lists and their status
                      -- showlist)

Certain lists can only be modified by an admin.  Other lists are for admin
viewing only.  See showlist help file for details.
