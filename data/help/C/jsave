jsave

Usage:  jsave [slot] [user_name] [gamenumber]

  This command is used to save games to your journal (see the "journal" help
file).  You can save games from a "history" file or from another journal.

To save from a "history" file
-----------------------------

  The general format is:  jsave slot user_name game_number.  For example:

    jsave A Friar 3

  where 'A' is your journal slot; 'Friar' is the handle of the player whose
  game you want to save -- whether it is your handle or the handle of another
  player; and '3' is the number of the game from that player's 'history' file.

To save from another journal
----------------------------

  The general format is:  jsave slot user_name slot.  For example:

    jsave B Rattlesnake A

  where 'B' is your journal slot, 'Rattlesnake' is the handle of the player
  whose journal game you want to transfer to your journal; 'A' is that
  player's journal slot for that game.

Using this journal-transfer feature, you can also relabel your own journal
entries.  For example:

  jsave A your_handle D

will take the journal game in slot 'D' and copy it to journal slot 'A'.  At
the moment, it is not possible to delete a slot (except by overwriting); that
capability will be added in the future.
