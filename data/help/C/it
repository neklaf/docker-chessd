it

Usage: it message

  This command sends a message to all persons open to hear shouts.  "It" is
similar to "shout" in that regard.  However, with "it" your chess server name
(or "handle") is always the first word of the message.  Also, the "it" message
may be preceded by various symbols depending on the chess server being used. 
The symbol string --> is typical.  This command has two aliases: "i" and ":".

  Here is an example: if your handle is HANDEL and you type "it thinks FICS
is great!", users will see the following message displayed --

	--> HANDEL thinks this server is great!

You, as the sender, will see the following --

	(##) HANDEL thinks this server is great!

where ## is the number of users who received the message.

SPECIAL NOTES: 

  (a) Use "cshout" rather than "it" for chess-related messages.

  (b) To contact just one user, use "tell".

  (c) If you want to contact a specific group of users, "tell" to a channel.

  (d) "It" and "shout" are similar.  Be familiar with their differences.

  (e) Persons who "it" too much, or in less than appropriate ways, may be
placed on the shout_abuse list.  Users on this list may only "shout" a certain
number of times per minute.  To see whether you are on the shout_abuse list,
or when you are permitted to "it" again, type "it" alone without a message. 
Excessive abuse can lead to heavier restrictions.

  (f) You can decide whether or not to hear an "it" from other users; setting
the "shout" variable to 0 (zero) filters these from being sent to you.
