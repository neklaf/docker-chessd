forward

Usage: forward [#]

  This command is used by a person examining a game in order to move forward
in the sequence of the game's moves.  The # is half_moves.  Example: "forward
40" -- game will go forward 40 half-moves (20 for White and 20 for Black).  
If # is not specified, 1 will be used.  If you type "forward 999" the game's
final position will be displayed.

SPECIAL NOTES

(1)  This command does not work for new games, only stored games.

(2)  This command works only on the mainline of stored games, not variations
branching off from the main line or moves continuing a game from a stored
position.
