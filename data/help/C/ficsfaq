     See Sparky (onenet) and hawk (helium)

14> Darooha, arcsin and POTZY have come for a peek.  What gives?
     Sometimes people pretend to be them.
     Do not abuse them if they log on.
     Our code is GNU - they can use our ideas and code on ICC if they
     want.  Remember who wrote it first.

15> What is ICC?
     Don't ask -- no free advertising -- you pay $49 for chess there.  :)

16> Can I shout about ICC?
     Yes, sure.  Given a choice to pay $49 or $0.  I'd take the $0.

17> Should I advertise FICS?
     Yes do so.  Watch you don't get nuked on ICC, though.  Do help ads there.
     Remember, Burger King burgers are free. :)

18> I can't shout! 
     Are you unreg or have you been muzzled?

19> I can't play rated.
     Have both of you set rated 1?
     Have you got the network vs local bug.

20> How do I use the -->name  thing I see displayed?
     Use "it" "i" or ":" followed by a message

21> The Hormone channel(51) has been reinstated I notice.
     Yes, but cleanish language only. This is a family server.
     Don't say something you wouldn't say in front of someone's kids.
     But maybe you would :)

22> The board is the wrong way up:
     Problem flip in style 12 -- old ZIICS and SLICS are affected.

23> Can't promote (xboard).
     Try e7e8 for a queen.

24> How do I continue a game that was adjourned?
     "match" the player again, and it will resume the game if the player
     accepts

25> I can't castle after king takeback.
     We know.

26> I can castle through check.
     This has been observed once.

27> Takeback gives wrong lastmove info.
     A bug.

28> Simuls don't work.
     They were broken once; they should be okay now.

29> My rating is over/under inflated
     There may be a bug somewhere.

30> +alias/+censor etc don't work.
     Try alias/unalias and censor/uncensor for now.

31> I've got an old account here, I can't remember my password.
     Ask an admin for help -- be ready to verify your email address.

34> Stats gives silly info.
     We know.

35> Is there any wild?
     Yes .. and rated, too.

36> Zippy won't shut up, too many shouts.
     Use censor [name], cshout (sshout on ICC) is coming.

37> How many channels can I be in?
     As many as you like, don't be in too many though as this takes
     up file space; do "help channel" for predefined ones.

39> The "who" listing appears staggered.
     Fixed soon.

40> How do I withdraw a match request?
     Type "withdraw".

41> I'm getting lag -- what can I do?
     Either Ctrl C to escape or use adjourn.
     Otherwise get your opponent to do "moretime #"  where # <= 600 seconds.

42> I suddenly got a Connection closed message.
     1> There has been a shutdown
     2> There has been a crash -- please bear with us.
     3> The server dumped you for some reason.
     4> You got nuked.

43> How long do shutdowns last and why?
     About 10 seconds.
     Sometimes we need to add new code or fix bugs -- please bear with us.

44> I get unprintable characters / delete don't work.
     Being fixed.

45> How do I get further help?
     Follow these steps:
     (a) "channel 1"
     (b) "tell 1 help me!"
     (c) When you are done, you can type "channel 1" exit this channel.

46> How do I pause a long file from scrolling?
     Use ctrl q and ctrl s -- or use your scroll bar.
     Also, "set height ##" fixes how many lines will be displayed at a time.
