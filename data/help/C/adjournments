adjournments

  Adjourned games are stored by the server until one of three things occurs:
(a) the game is later resumed and completed, (b) one player resigns, or (c)
the game is adjudicated.  Adjourned games can also be examined for purposes of
analysis.  Typed "stored" to view the list of your adjourned games.  Games are
adjourned either by agreement of both players or if a player disconnects
suddenly; games are not adjourned if the server crashes, however.


RESUMING AN ADJOURNED GAME

  Your game can be resumed when your opponent is logged on to the server. 
Type "match opponent_name" to request that you and your opponent continue your
game.  Your opponent can either accept or decline this request.


RESIGNING AN ADJOURNED GAME

  Your game can be resigned even when your opponent is not logged on.  Type
"resign opponent_name" to do this.  Your opponent will be notified of your
decision.


ADJUDICATION OF AN ADJOURNED GAME

  If you have difficulty resuming your game with your opponent after repeated
attempts, you can have your game adjudicated by an admin.  The "adjudication"
help file outlines the procedure to follow for requesting an adjudication.


EXAMINING AN ADJOURNED GAME

  You can examine an adjourned game using the "examine" command.  You will be
able to analyze possible continuations of the game.  For the most part, this
analysis has the same restrictions as adjournments for over-the-board chess
games: consultation is permitted.  However, when your game resumes, you must
play without consultation or notes of any kind.
