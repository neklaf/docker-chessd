shout_abuse

  This help file is to give some guidance on the accepted use of shouting.
Breaking these guidelines may result in sanctions, such as a quota on your
shouts or even worse muzzling (your shouting privileges revoked).  REMEMBER:
some people use text boards but still have shout on, which means that
unnecessary shouts scroll their screen unnecessarily.

THINGS THAT ANNOY OTHERS -- hence shout quotas or other sanctions:

  Saying the same or similar things several times in a row.  For example:

     --> DAV is here.
     --> DAV is here.
     --> DAV greets all.
     --> DAV is here.

  Annoying others by imitating system messages.  For example:

     --> DAV has left a message for you.
     --> DAV tells you: hi how are you?

  Talking about something that should be in a channel -- after warnings.
  The channel help file ("help channel") gives a list of all pre-defined
  channels.

  Also too much hugging and kissing -- except for login/out greetings; use
    channel 51 for that please -- but keep the language clean!

  Cursing and cussing others on shouts (including don't play xxx for yyy
    reason).

  Shouting far too often, lengthy shouts (e.g., ASCII pictures) beyond about
    five or so lines).

  Holding two person conversations on shout.

  Anything else an admin sees fit.



THINGS THAT ARE FORBIDDEN -- hence muzzle or (worse) a ban from FICS:

  Swearing, in general or at others.

  Discriminatory remarks -- see help etiquette.

  Constant shout abuse.
 
  Anything else an admin sees fit. 

 
  NOTE: any sanctions that are made against you are likely to be recorded,
so punishment may be incremental for a second offence.  A bad comment
file is also likely to get you barred from privileges that may occur
time to time, including the possibility of adminship.
