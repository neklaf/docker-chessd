  To get a registered account on this server, send a message to the following
address ...

    chess@caissa.onenet.net 

... and use as the Subject: "Fics Registration".  The text of your message
should read (please make the appropriate substitutions as indicated by the
<>'s markers):

  fics_addplayer <handle> "<First M. Last>" <email-address> <human|computer>

**** Be sure to read "help handle" on the server's online help reguarding
**** handle name policy!

Quotation marks MUST be used around the name field.  Do NOT include the <>'s
markers in your text; they are used above only to indicate where you need to
place information.  If this is a human account, 'human' need not be specified;
however, 'computer' MUST be used if you are registering a computer on FICS
(see "computers" help file).

  Here are two examples that would register Sparky with the correct name and
email information:
 
  fics_addplayer Sparky "Chris L. Petroff" chris@onenet.net              -OR-
  fics_addplayer Sparky "Chris L. Petroff" chris@onenet.net human


SPECIAL NOTES:

(1)  PLEASE SELECT YOUR HANDLE CAREFULLY!  We do not change handles for
accounts once they have been created.  So choose a handle that you are willing
to keep.  If for some reason the handle you want is already taken, you will be
notified.  To check in advance whether a handle is already being used, use the
"handles" command.  Lastly, your handle must not be offensive!  Offensive
handles will be removed.  (See "handle" help file.)

(2)  ONLINE REGISTRATION WILL BE LIMITED.  Email registration provides
security for users and reduces mistakes.  Contact an admin about registration
if you have difficulties with email registration or if it is impossible.

(3)  Please tell us if you are an FM, IM or GM (master's titles for
international competition).  We can include you on our master's lists.
