noplay

Usage: +|-|= noplay [user]

  When a player is on your noplay list, all match requests from that player
will be declined automatically.  Here are the variations of the command
possible:

    +noplay user     Add "user" to noplay list
    -noplay user     Remove "user" from noplay list
    =noplay          Display your noplay list

  "Censor" will also filter a user's match requests.  Use a formula to filter
match requests of particular types.
