  The user's ratings for each type of chess are displayed, along with the
Glicko RD (or index of ratings variability), the total results from games
played, and the best or highest rating for each type.  You can also tell (1)
whether the user is (1) currently logged on and, if so, for how long and
whether his/she is idle, (2) playing, observing or examining a game and, if
so, which game it is, and (3) currently running a version of timeseal or not. 
Beneath the ratings are note lines (a user's "plan" or "notes") the user can
add using the set command.


SPECIAL NOTES: 

(a) Your e-mail address is automatically displayed to you beneath your ratings
table; it is NOT displayed to other users -- unless of course you include your
address as part of your finger notes.

(b) Best ratings and dates are only given *after* you have played 20 games of
a given type.

(c) If a user has not played rated games of a given type, the rating will be
indicated as ---- and the RD will be 350.0.

(d) If a user is not logged on, the display will indicate when he/she last
disconnected and the timeseal section will not appear.
