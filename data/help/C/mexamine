mexamine

Usage: mexamine user

  This command is used by a person examining a game in order to allow other
users to move the pieces and execute commands in examine mode.  The user must
first be observing the game in order for "mexamine" to work.  Here are the
steps: (1) enter examine mode, (2) have another user "observe" that game, (3)
"mexamine that_user".

NOTE:  As long as there is at least one examiner, the game continues even if
the first examiner leaves that game.
