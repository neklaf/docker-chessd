interfaces

  It is possible to play chess matches on the server by typing your moves and
having board positions displayed in a simple style.  However, it is also
possible to use a graphics interface for making moves and displaying board
positions.  A graphics interface is a software program designed to decode the
information sent to you by FICS and display board information using stylized
graphics.  It also allows you to make moves by moving pieces on its board
using a mouse.

  Which graphics interface will work best for you will depend upon the kind
of computer you are using, and the way you are being connected to the server.
Many graphics interfaces are available at the main chess ftp site
(ics.onenet.net).  Feel free to ask FICS users about what is working best for
them, and feel free to examine the files at ics.onenet.net.

  If you use a graphics interface, you will need to select the board style
that is most appropriate for your software.

List of interfaces
------------------

  Listed in this helpfile are details of graphical interfaces.  Often it is
difficult to play chess using the 'ASCII' boards the server generates.  They
aren't easy to see, and are affected by other information such as shouts.  The
graphical ones give you a proper chess board on which to view your pieces,
making your chess easier to play.

##  Not yet working well on FICS.
*   No account on FICS yet. 

Note:  The handles of the authors may refer to the handles of people at the
       old Aics.  Certain ones may be different people here or non-existent.
       Most interfaces should work; both the authors and the FICS programmers
       would like feedback if you have problems with one here.


  The listing will explain which interfaces will run on your particular
set-up and in which directory to find it. It may have comments from the
users/authors of the interfaces to help you choose.

  If you have any further questions or trouble please contact an admin.

Instructions for getting an interface
-------------------------------------

  The above graphical interfaces can be found at the anonymous ftp site
chess.onenet.net  (URL: ftp://ftp.onenet.net/)  Most come with some
instructions.  :-)

  Pick one, use ftp (read the "ftp_hints" help file for assistance), Netscape
or some similar software to access it over the Internet, transfer it to your
local PC system or workstation via your preferred method (zmodem, kermit for
most non tcp/ip dialup connections), unpack it (most use standard archival
software or are self-extracting), and set it up.  :-)

Comments on interfaces
----------------------

  This listing will explain the interfaces in a little more detail.  Many have
comments from the users/authors of the interfaces.  Also indicated are the
directories at onenet.net that hold the interfaces.

 If you have any further questions or trouble please contact an admin.


PC and compatibles (Using DOS and modem): pub/chess/DOS 
-----------------------------------------

  ZIICS by Zek:
    A very popular interface for the PC.  ZIICS requires a regular modem
    connection and a graphics adapter (VGA, EGA, CGA or Hercules).  In VGA
    there are several styles of sets from 32 pixels per square to 56 pixels
    per square (almost fills the screen vertically).  You can configure the
    colors and the functions of the buttons by editing a text file.

  GIICS by LLama:

  JIICS by Peluri:
    You will need VGA and a mouse to use this.

  Monarc by Kevster:


PC and compatibles (Using DOS and TCP/IP): pub/chess/DOS
------------------------------------------

  NGIICS by LLama:


PC and compatibles (Using Windows and modem): pub/chess/Win3
---------------------------------------------

  Raja (elephant) by Christian:
    Works well with Win95.  Noticable speed increase (and its not even 32 bit
    yet!). Tested with 486-DX4-100.  [note from Christian]

  bludrake by Bloodrake:


PC and compatibles (Using Windows and TCP/IP): pub/chess/Win3

  SLICS by dfong:

  Toolkit by MaDHaTteR:
    Should work here soon.


PC and compatibles (Using Windows NT(or 95) and TCP/IP): pub/chess/Win3
--------------------------------------------------------

  WinBoard by mann:
    finger mann for the latest details.


PC and compatibles (OS/2 PM ): pub/chess/DOS
------------------------------

  PMICS by woof:


Unix (Xwindows): pub/chess/X
----------------

  XBoard by mann:
    Certainly the best of the Unix interfaces and still is being supported to
    work better at FICS.  Owners of Unix machines are well advised to get this
    interface.  It is also suitable for use with GNUchess.   [comment by DAV] 
    Finger mann for the latest details.

  Aics by Christian:
    Will work with 2.04 Kickstart and should be compatible with newer
    versions.
