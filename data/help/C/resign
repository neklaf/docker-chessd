resign

Usage: resign  [name]

  Resigns the game you are playing and gives your opponent the win.  You will
then be available for another game.

  It is possible to resign an adjourned game by including your opponent's
name.  For example, "resign Hawk" would resign your adjourned game with Hawk. 
Before you do this, make sure that the game has been stored.  When you resign
an adjourned game, a notification message will be sent to your opponent.
