tell
 
Usage: tell user message

  "Tell" transmits your message to the user specified.  The server gives you
some feedback that the message has been sent.  You will also be told whether
the user is playing a game currently, or is not even logged on at the moment. 
"t" is an alias for "tell".

  As a shortcut, you can use "." as an alias for "tell user" when you want to
send another message to the last person you told.  That way you can keep
conversations going easily.

  When you receive a "tell" it will appear like this:
	<User> tells you: <message>

  The 'user' can also be a channel number in order to send a message to a group
of users having that channel activated.  In this case, you as sender will see
the following display after sending your message: (# -> (##)) where # is the
channel number and ## is the number of people on that channel that received
your message.

  As a shortcut, you can use "," as an alias for "tell #" and your message
will be sent to the last channel you gave in a "tell" command.  (Compare to
"xtell" command.)


SPECIAL NOTES

  (a) The server remembers both the last user to whom and the last channel to
which you have told something.  For this reason, "." and "," are separate
aliases and do not interfere with each other.

  (b) A special command, "say", can be used for communicating with an opponent
during or directly following a chess game.

  (c) Another special command, "message", sends a message to a user so that it
can be stored for future use.

  (d) You can decide whether or not to hear a "tell" from unregistered users;
setting the "tell" variable to 0 (zero) filters these from being sent to you.
