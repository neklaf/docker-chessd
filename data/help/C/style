style

Usage: style n

  Sets your 'style' variable to n.  Equivalent to "set style n".  This command
allows you to choose among the various board display options.
 
 1.   Standard ICS board in ascii format (default)
 2.   USA-Today Sports Center-style board
 3.   Experimental vt-100 ANSI board for dark backgrounds
 4.   Experimental vt-100 ANSI board for light backgrounds
 5.   Style suggested by ajpierce@med.unc.edu
 6.   Email Board suggested by Thomas Fought (tlf@rsch.oclc.org)
 7.   Miniature board
 8.   ICS interface maker board -- raw data dump
 9.   last 2 moves only (previous non-verbose mode)
10.   Alternate raw dump
11.   Same as 8, but with verbose moves ("P/e3-e4", instead of "e4")
12.   Similar to style 10.
13.   Displays board in color for SGI machines -- white versus purple pieces
      with purple and black squares (for b/w monitors it would display as bold
      and regular).

  Some graphics interfaces work only with specific board styles.  Determine
which one is best for your setup.

  Suggestions on different styles are always welcome.
