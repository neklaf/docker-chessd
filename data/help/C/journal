journal

  The journal feature is a way to save games as long as you want to.  History
games, remember, get overwritten as you play more games; only the most recent
games are saved.  The journal feature allows you to save games for a longer
period of time.

  The journal file for most players has 26 available slots.  These slots are
denoted by the single letters from A to Z.  Games in your journal are referred
to by their letters.

  There are two things you need to know in order to make this feature work for
you: (i) how to save a game to your journal, and (ii) how to review a game
from your journal.


SAVING A GAME TO A JOURNAL
--------------------------

  The "jsave" command is used to save games to your journal.  Please refer to
that help file for details


SHOWING THE CONTENTS OF A JOURNAL
---------------------------------

  To read the contents of a journal, type:

  journal [user_name]

If the user_name is omitted, then the contents of your journal will be
displayed.

  There are several commands you can use in order to display information about
an individual game: (a) examine; (b) smoves; and (c) mailstored.  See those
help files for further details.


PRIVATE JOURNALS
----------------

  It is possible to hide your journal from other users (except admins) by
using the 'jprivate' variable:

  set jprivate 1   ---   hides your journal

  set jprivate 0   ---   allows others to access your journal
