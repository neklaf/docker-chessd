whisper

Usage: whisper message 
LIMITED TO REGISTERED USERS

  Sends your message to all the observers of a game but NOT to the players. 
For this reason, using whisper (rather than kibitz) is a more polite way of
discussing a game with other observers without having your message heard by
the two players.  (Only users with a 'kiblevel' variable setting might not
receive your message.)  You must be observing or playing a game in order to
use this command.  The standard alias for "whisper" is '#'.
