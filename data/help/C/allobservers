allobservers

Usage: allobservers [game,user]

  If a game is specified then all users observing or examining that game are
displayed.  However, if there are no observers for that game, nothing will be
displayed.

  If no game is specified, then all users observing or examining games in
progress are displayed.  However, if there are no observers or examiners for
ANY game, nothing will be displayed.

  The display will have this format: Game #, Players, Observers.  For example:

      Observing 18 [DAV vs. friar]: Thumper, Charity, Shane
      Examining 29 (scratch): #Friar, loon

For examined games, there are examiners (people changing the position, noted
by #) and observers.
