backward

Usage: backward [#]

  This command is used by a person examining a game in order to move backward
in the sequence of the game's moves.  If # is not specified, 1 will be used.

  In the case of a stored game, you may move forward again using the "forward"
command, but in the case of a new game you will need to move the pieces again.

SPECIAL NOTE: The "revert" command is a way to move backward to the branch
from the main variation being examined.
