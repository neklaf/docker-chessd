kibitz

Usage: kibitz message 
LIMITED TO REGISTERED USERS

  Sends your message to all observers AND PLAYERS of a game, with these
exceptions: (a) users with their kibitz variables set to 0 (off), and (b)
users who have set a kiblevel.  You must be observing or playing a game in
order to use this command.  The standard alias for kibitz is "*".

  In order to listen to kibitzes, you must have your kibitz variable on ("set
kibitz 1").  If you want to listen to kibitzes only from players of a given
chess ability or higher, use the kiblevel variable.

  When a kibitz is displayed, the kibitzer's rating will be shown (the higher
of blitz and standard will be used).  However, (a) if the kibitzer has a chess
master title (GM, IM, FM, NM), this title will be displayed instead of the
rating; (b) if the kibitzer is an admin on duty, a '*' will be displayed.


SPECIAL NOTES:

(a)  It is considered bad manners to discuss the game with other observers by
using kibitz because doing so might assist the players.  Instead, use
"whisper" in order to discuss a game you and others are observing without
interfering with the play of the game.

(b)  If you are observing more than one game at once, using kibitz can be
tricky.  It is possible for the kibitzed message to be sent to another game,
if the game being observed changes suddenly.
