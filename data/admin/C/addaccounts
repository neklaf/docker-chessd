2> Extra user accounts.

     1> Is not currently being sanctioned (eg on abuser list)

     2> Comment file is clean or nearly clean (check the comments don't
         assume because someone has more than one comment they have been
         an abuser). Repeat offenders must be refused additional accounts.

     3> The player is not known to cause (much) trouble.

    If in doubt please check with sveshi (AFICS) first.

   Must put in comments list of the player applying for it the name and type
  of account

     Eg. addcomment FishFood DAV's blind account

   Must add in the realname of the account, the handle of the player and what
  type of account it is.

   Finally add it to a list with +listname [name] if appropriate.

   Do NOT revert an additional account to a player account without good reason
  (eg old account was destroyed somehow). Check with sveshi (AFICS) if unsure..
