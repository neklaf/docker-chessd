canewse

Usage: canewse # [n]
RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.

  This command sets the expiration of the anews item to a number of days [n].
The '#' is the number of the anews index.  If the number of days is not
specified, the anews item will be perpetual; otherwise, it will expire in
the specified number of days and be removed from the anews index altogether.
The expiration of anews items will force the anews index out of its running
sequence.

NOTICE:  To expire an anews item immediately, use 'canewse # 0'.
