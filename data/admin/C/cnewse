cnewse

Usage: cnewse # [n]
RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.

  This command sets the expiration of the news item to a number of days [n].
The '#' is the number of the news index.  If the number of days is not
specified, the news item will be perpetual; otherwise, it will expire in the
specified number of days and be removed from the news index altogether.  The
expiration of news items will force the news index out of its running sequence.

NOTICE:  To expire a news item immediately, use 'cnewse # 0'.
