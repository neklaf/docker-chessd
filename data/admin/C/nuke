nuke 

Usage: nuke user
RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.

  This command disconnects the user from the server.  The user is informed
that she/he has been nuked by the admin named and a comment is automatically
placed in the user's files (if she/he is a registered user, of course).  Do
not nuke someone for fun!
