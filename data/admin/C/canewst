Usage: cnewst # message
RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.

   This command allows you to change the title of an anews item that had
previously been created using 'canewsi'.  The '#' is the number of the anews
index and 'message' is the new title.  The message length limit in 'canewsi'
also applies here.
