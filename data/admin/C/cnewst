Usage: cnewst # message
RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.

   This command allows you to change the title of a news item that had
previously been created using 'cnewsi'.  The '#' is the number of the news
index and 'message' is the new title.  The message length limit in 'cnewsi'
also applies here.
