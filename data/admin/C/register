              *** Email registration is now automated! ***


To get a registered account, send a message to this address:

    chess@caissa.onenet.net 

... and use as the Subject: "Fics Registration"

Include a line like the following as the text of your message (please make the
appropriate substitutions as indicated by the <>'s markers):

    fics_addplayer <handle> "<First M. Last>" <email-address> <human|computer>

Here is an example which would register Sparky with the correct name and email
information:
 
  Ex:   fics_addplayer Sparky "Chris L. Petroff" chris@onenet.net
  or:   fics_addplayer Sparky "Chris L. Petroff" chris@onenet.net human


SPECIAL NOTES:

(1)  Quotation marks MUST be used around the name field.

(2)  If this is a human account, 'human' need not be specified.  However,
     'computer' MUST be used if you are registering a computer on FICS (see
     "computers" help file).

(3)  Do NOT include the <>'s markers in your text.  They are used above only
     to indicate where you need to place information.

(4)  Please tell us if you are an FM, IM or GM (master's titles for
     international competition).
