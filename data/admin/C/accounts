These accounts were created in order to aid admins with their work.  They
shouldn't be used for any other purpose.  Some of these accounts have admin
status.

      adjudicate - an account for adjudication requests
             Bug - an account for bug reports
          filter - an account to log filtered sites/reasons for filtering
      Suggestion - an account for suggestions
        vacation - an account for admin holiday notification
       helpfiles - an account for help file updating requests

If you need to use an account but don't know the password, ask an admin who
does.
