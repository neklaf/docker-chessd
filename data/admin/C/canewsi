Usage: canewsi message
RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.

  This command adds a new item to the anews index.  The message is limited to
45 characters for formating purposes.  In essence, the anews index works like
a newspaper headline, giving admins enough information to know whether they
should read the entire anews file for that item.  A list of recent anews items
is displayed by the 'anews' command.

  After creating the anews item, the command reports the anews item number
along with a reminder to create an anews file if necessary.  This command
replaced the 'createanews' command.
