filter

Usage: [+,-,=]filter ip
RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.


  This list bans unreg logins from a site where "ip" is a full or partial ip
address.  The number of levels in the "ip" affects how much filtering is made. 
An "ip" of 123.124.125.126 will ban a machine, 123.124.125 will ban the
server, and 123.124  will probably ban the whole site.  A special account has
been established for documenting the need to filter logins: "filter".

  When you filter a site, please leave a message in the filter account:
"message filter <explanation>".  To read the log of messages in this account,
type "ahelp filtered".
