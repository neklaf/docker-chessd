Usage: asetmaxplayer [n]
RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.

  With an argument, this command raises or lowers the level at which logons
from non-admins will be filtered.  If an argument is supplied, it is checked
to make sure it is both within the limits of the operating system and at least
minimally safe.  Without an argument, the command displays detailed
information about the current limits.

  The greater of max_connections-50 and 200 is a threshhold for triggering
guest login restrictions.  When the number of non-admin users is above that
value, unregistered logins are turned away with a nice message.
