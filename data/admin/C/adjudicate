adjudicate

Usage: adjudicate white_player black_player result
RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.

  Adjudicates a game between white_player and black_player.  The result is one
of: abort, draw, white, black.  "Abort" cancels the game (no win, loss or
draw), "white" gives white_player the win, "black" gives black_player the win,
and "draw" gives a draw.  Both white_player and black_player will be notified
by server messages concerning the adjudication.

  In most cases, the game will be a stored (adjourned) game for which one
opponent has made an adjudication request.  To list games for which
adjudications have been requested, type "ahelp adjrequests".  However, there
may be occasions when a game in progress needs to be adjudicated online --
such as when a computer fails to move or cannot accept a draw in a clearly
drawn position.

  For guidelines about adjudications, see "adjud_info".
