Usage: canewsf # message
RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.

   This command allows you to add additional information about an anews item
that had previously been created using 'canewsi'.  The '#' is the number of
the news index and 'message' is the additional text.  You can also modify a
previous anews item description and thus update the anews item easily.
