remplayer

Usage:  remplayer name
RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.

   Removes an account.  A copy of its files are saved under .rem.* which can
be found in the appropriate directory (useful in case of an accident).
   
   The account's details, messages, games and logons are all saved as 'zombie'
files.  These zombie accounts are not listed in handles or totals.  Although a
handle may have been removed, it is not possible for another user to register
with this handle -OR- to register for a new account using email registration. 
The autoregister program checks for regular as well as remplayered accounts.

   Please do not use this command unless necessary, such as for multiple
accounts or inappropriate handles.  To stop a player from having access to an
account, it may be preferable to use the "asetpasswd" command instead.
