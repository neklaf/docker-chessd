raisedead

Usage:  raisedead oldname [newname]
RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS

   Restores an account that has been previously removed using "remplayer". 
The zombie files from which it came are removed.  Under most circumstances,
you restore the account to the same handle it had before (oldname).  However,
in some circumstances you may need to restore the account to a different
handle, in which case you include "newname" as the new handle.  After
"raisedead", you may need to use the "asetpasswd" command to get the player
started again as a registered user, especially if the account had been locked
by setting the password to *.
